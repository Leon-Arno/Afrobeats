          <h2>What is Afrobeats?</h2>
          <p>
            Afrobeat is a music genre that fuses African music with Black
            American influences to produce a compelling hybrid of culture and
            sound. The genre is largely the creation of Nigerian artist
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fela_Kuti" target="_blank"
              >Fela Kuti</a
            >
            who, with his band Africa 70, forged a rhythmic mix of West African
            beats (predominantly Nigerian and Ghanaian) and American jazz,
            <a
              href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/soul-music-guide"
              target="_blank"
              >soul</a
            >, and
            <a
              href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/funk-music-guide"
              target="_blank"
              >funk</a
            >, which was shot through with a potent streak of political
            awareness. Kuti’s music lit the fuse for Afrobeat, and the torch was
            carried forward by a mix of African artists, like Kuti’s former
            drummer, Tony Allen. In the West, performers Brian Eno and David
            Byrne from The Talking Heads drew on Afrobeat for their
            groundbreaking album Remain in Light (1980). Listeners can still
            hear Kuti’s influence in the music of his sons, Femi Kuti and Seun
            Kuti, and modern Western bands like the Grammy-winning Antibalas.
            Afrobeat music is frequently labeled as Afrobeats, an umbrella term
            for a far-ranging music scene from West Africa and the United
            Kingdom, which incorporates many popular music styles. The two
            sounds share only a common heritage.

          <h2>History of Afrobeats</h2>
          <p>
            The history of Afrobeat began in the early twentieth century when
            musicians from Ghana combined West African regional music with
            Western jazz and calypso. The resulting new sound became known as
            highlife, which continued to fold additional Western influences into
            its heady mix over the next few decades. laborum ducimus.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Kuti and Africa 70 carve out the sound: Nigerian musician Fela
              Aníkúlápó-Kuti, who began his career playing in an array of
              African highlife and jazz bands, absorbed the sounds of soul,
              jazz, soca, and rhythm and blues during various tours of America
              and the United Kingdom. He then unleashed this formidable creation
              in his band, Nigeria 70 (later Africa 70), debuting his unique new
              musical style in the early 1970s.
            </li>
            <li>
              Development of the core sound and politics: With their debut
              album, Zombie, Kuti and Africa 70 established the core sound of
              Afrobeat, which freely mixed jazz and highlife with the epic funk
              of James Brown, reggae and Caribbean rhythm, and psychedelic rock.
              Kuti sang over tracks in English and Yoruba, leading the band on
              saxophone, keyboards, and other instruments. He also lent Afrobeat
              a political side by criticizing the human rights records of
              Nigeria and the United States on record and in his marathon live
              performances.
            </li>
            <li>
              Continuation under Egypt 80: Kuti remained a major artist in
              Africa and abroad until his death in 1997; his son Seun renamed
              the band Egypt 80 and continued to record and perform, as did
              Seun’s brother, Femi, who enjoyed a degree of popularity similar
              to that of his father.
            </li>
            <li>
              Afrofunk is born: The most successful figure from Kuti’s orbit was
              undoubtedly drummer Tony Allen, who expanded on the Afrobeat sound
              by mixing in elements of hip-hop, dub, and electronica to form a
              new subgenre called Afrofunk. Allen enjoyed even wider exposure
              than his former bandleader through collaborations with Air, Zap
              Mama, and Damon Albarn of Blur, among others.
            </li>
            <li>
              Crossover influence: The work of Fela Kuti and Allen was the
              bedrock of Afrobeat, but jazz musicians like Roy Ayers also
              recorded Afrobeat-inspired music in the 1970s. Ayers toured
              Nigeria with the elder Kuti in the late ’70s. Contemporary artists
              like Antibalas and Zongo Junction—both hailing from Brooklyn, New
              York— have carved careers out of the Afrobeat sound. Mainstream
              rock and soul bands, like TV on the Radio and the Budos Band, have
              also recorded songs with an Afrobeat flavor.

            From Nigeria to the world: Afrobeats is having a global moment
          </h3>
          <p>
            Another Grammy Awards season and there is a growing list of African
            nominees. For African music enthusiasts, it is heartwarming that
            recognition is being accorded to practitioners in the Afrobeats
            space.
          </p>

          <p>
            Afrobeat and Afrobeats, although related, are quite distinct.
            Afrobeats is the genre that emerged when West African pop music
            became cool. Its origins coincide with the media liberalisation that
            accompanied the “final” wave of democratisation in Africa from 1999.
            More than this, it is a convenient term for Europe to refer to music
            coming out of Africa, distinct from Euro-American pop.
